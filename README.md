In December 2017 **Daniel Wainwright** [reported that the price of the average bottle of gin has risen by about a quarter in the past five years, with the accompanying tonic water also rising](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42286701). The story was based on historical price data obtained from the price monitoring service MySupermarket, which was then adjusted for inflation. 

Dan also spoke to distillers, The Wine and Spirits Trade Association, and Vhari Russell of the Food Marketing Expert, and visited The Gin Vault in Birmingham to speak to staff and customers about changes in the gin market.
